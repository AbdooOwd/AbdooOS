# AbdooOS

A simple little OS made with love by me for fun. I think it is a very
fascinating and exciting project. My main ressource was 
[BrokenThorn's OS Development series](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html).

## About C++ ...
I was able to make the project support C++ libraries and code.
But I decided to not make it compatible, and this because
I prefer using C. It's true that I should make the project 
"open", but I'll refactor C++ code later. My only goal 
right now is understanding the structure of the project.
I think C++ for this project is useless *(except when using classes)*
because most of the C++ code is just C code encapsulated in a
`extern "C" { ... code ... }`.

Don't worry, when I finish the **\*core\*** of the project 
(a working shell and file system), I'll make it C++ compatible.

> btw C coders are chads :sunglasses:
